0,"Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. 
 Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and others. Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has the disease. 
 Avoid going to crowded places. Why? Where people come together in crowds, you are more likely to come into close contact with someone that has COIVD-19 and it is more difficult to maintain physical distance of 1 metre (3 feet). 
 Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect you. 
 Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately and wash your hands. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19. 
 Stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover. Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house, wear a mask to avoid infecting others. Why? Avoiding contact with others will protect them from possible COVID-19 and other viruses. 
 If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention, but call by telephone in advance if possible and follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections. 
 Keep up to date on the latest information from trusted sources, such as WHO or your local and national health authorities. Why? Local and national authorities are best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves.",Avoiding Spread,WHO
1,"To protect yourself and others against COVID-19, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer or wash your hands with soap and water. If you use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, make sure you use and store it carefully. 
 Keep alcohol-based hand sanitizers out of children’s reach. Teach them how to apply the sanitizer and monitor its use. 
 Apply a coin-sized amount on your hands. There is no need to use a large amount of the product. 
 Avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose immediately after using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, as it can cause irritation. 
 Hand sanitizers recommended to protect against COVID-19 are alcohol-based and therefore can be flammable. Do not use before handling fire or cooking. 
 Under no circumstance, drink or let children swallow an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. It can be poisonous. 
 Remember that washing your hands with soap and water is also effective against COVID-19.",Using Hand Sanitisers,WHO
2,"The COVID-19 pandemic means that many of us are staying at home and sitting down more than we usually do. It’s hard for a lot of us to do the sort of exercise we normally do. It’s even harder for people who don’t usually do a lot of physical exercise. But at a time like this, it’s very important for people of all ages and abilities to be as active as possible. 
 WHO’s Be Active campaign aims to help you do just that - and to have some fun at the same time. Remember - Just taking a short break from sitting, by doing 3-4 minutes of light intensity physical movement, such as walking or stretching, will help ease your muscles and improve blood circulation and muscle activity. 
 Regular physical activity benefits both the body and mind. It can reduce high blood pressure, help manage weight and reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and various cancers - all conditions that can increase susceptibility to COVID-19. 
 It also improves bone and muscle strength and increases balance, flexibility and fitness. For older people, activities that improve balance help to prevent falls and injuries. 
 Regular physical activity can help give our days a routine and be a way to stay in contact with family and friends. It’s also good for our mental health - reducing the risk of depression, cognitive decline and delay the onset of dementia - and improve overall feelings. 
 How much physical activity is recommended for your age group? 
 WHO has recommendations on the amount of physical activity people of all ages should do to benefit their health and wellbeing. 
 Infants under 1 year of age: All infants should be physically active several times a day. For those not yet mobile, this includes at least 30 minutes in prone position (tummy time), as floor-based play, spread throughout the day while awake.  
 Children under 5 years of age : All young children should spend at least 180 minutes a day in a variety of types of physical activities at any intensity. 3-4 year old children should spend at least 60 minutes of this time in moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity. 
 Children and adolescents aged 5-17 years : All children and adolescents should do at least 60 minutes a day of moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity. This should include activities that strengthen muscle and bone, at least 3 days per week. Doing more than 60 minutes of physical activity daily will provide additional health benefits.  
  Adults aged over 18 years: All adults should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity throughout the week, or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity throughout the week.  For additional health benefits, adults should increase their moderate-intensity physical activity to 300 minutes per week, or equivalent. For developing and maintaining musculoskeletal health, muscle-strengthening activities involving major muscle groups should be done on 2 or more days a week. In addition, older adults with poor mobility should do physical activity to enhance balance and prevent falls on 3 or more days per week. ",Staying Healthy,WHO
3,"Eating a healthy diet is very important during the COVID-19 pandemic. What we eat and drink can affect our body’s ability to prevent, fight and recover from infections. While no foods or dietary supplements can prevent or cure COVID-19 infection, healthy diets are important for supporting immune systems. Good nutrition can also reduce the likelihood of developing other health problems, including obesity, heart disease, diabetes and some types of cancer. For babies, a healthy diet means exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months, with the introduction of nutritious and safe foods to complement breastmilk from age 6 months to 2 years and beyond. For young children, a healthy and balanced diet is essential for growth and development. For older people, it can help to ensure healthier and more active lives. 
 Tips for maintaining a healthy diet: eat a variety of food, including fruits and vegetables; Every day, eat a mix of wholegrains like wheat, maize and rice, legumes like lentils and beans, plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables , with some foods from animal sources (e.g. meat, fish, eggs and milk); Choose wholegrain foods like unprocessed maize, millet, oats, wheat and brown rice when you can; they are rich in valuable fibre and can help you feel full for longer; For snacks, choose raw vegetables, fresh fruit, and unsalted nuts. 
 Cut back on salt: Limit salt intake to 5 grams (equivalent to a teaspoon) a day; When cooking and preparing foods, use salt sparingly and reduce use of salty sauces and condiments (like soy sauce, stock or fish sauce); If using canned or dried food, choose varieties of vegetables, nuts and fruit, without added salt and sugars; Remove the salt shaker from the table, and experiment with fresh or dried herbs and spices for added flavor instead; Check the labels on food and choose products with lower sodium content. 
  Eat moderate amounts of fats and oils: Replace butter, ghee and lard with healthier fats like olive, soy, sunflower or corn oil when cooking; Choose white meats like poultry and fish which are generally lower in fats than red meat; trim meat of visible fat and limit the consumption of processed meats; Select low-fat or reduced-fat versions of milk and dairy products; Avoid processed, baked and fried foods that contain industrially produced trans-fat; Try steaming or boiling instead of frying food when cooking. 
 Limit sugar intake: Limit intake of sweets and sugary drinks such as fizzy drinks, fruit juices and juice drinks, liquid and powder concentrates, flavoured water, energy and sports drinks, ready-to-drink tea and coffee and flavoured milk drinks; Choose fresh fruits instead of sweet snacks such as cookies, cakes and chocolate. When other dessert options are chosen, ensure that they are low in sugar and consume small portions; Avoid giving sugary foods to children. Salt and sugars should not be added to complementary foods given to children under 2 years of age, and should be limited beyond that age. 
 Stay hydrated: Drink enough water: Good hydration is crucial for optimal health. Whenever available and safe for consumption, tap water is the healthiest and cheapest drink. Drinking water instead of sugar-sweetened beverages is a simple way to limit your intake of sugar and excess calories. 
 Avoid hazardous and harmful alcohol use: Alcohol is not a part of a healthy diet. Drinking alcohol does not protect against COVID-19 and can be dangerous. Frequent or excessive alcohol consumption increases your immediate risk of injury, as well as causing longer-term effects like liver damage, cancer, heart disease and mental illness. There is no safe level of alcohol consumption. 
 Breastfeed babies and young children: Breastmilk is the ideal food for infants. It is safe, clean and contains antibodies which help protect against many common childhood illnesses. Babies should be breastfed exclusively during the first 6 months of life, as breast milk provides all the nutrients and fluids they need; From 6 months of age, breast milk should be complemented with a variety of adequate, safe and nutrient-dense foods. Breastfeeding should continue under babies at 2 years of age or beyond; Women with COVID-19 can breastfeed if they wish to do so and should take infection prevention and control measures. 
  Tips for Food Safety during COVID-19: There is no evidence that COVID-19 can be spread through contact with food or food packaging. COVID-19 is generally thought to be spread from person to person. However, it’s always important to practice good hygiene when handling food to prevent any food-borne illnesses. Follow WHO’s Five keys to safer food: Keep clean; Separate raw and cooked; Cook thoroughly; Keep food at safe temperatures; Use safe water and raw materials.",Healthy Eating,WHO
4,"Looking after our mental health: 
 As countries introduce measures to restrict movement as part of efforts to reduce the number of people infected with COVID-19, more and more of us are making huge changes to our daily routines. The new realities of working from home, temporary unemployment, home-schooling of children, and lack of physical contact with other family members, friends and colleagues take time to get used to. Adapting to lifestyle changes such as these, and managing the fear of contracting the virus and worry about people close to us who are particularly vulnerable, are challenging for all of us. They can be particularly difficult for people with mental health conditions. Fortunately, there are lots of things that we can do to look after our own mental health and to help others who may need some extra support and care.Here are tips and advice that we hope you will find useful. 
 Keep informed: Listen to advice and recommendations from your national and local authorities. Follow trusted news channels, such as local and national TV and radio, and keep up-to-date with the latest news from @WHO on social media. 
 Have a routine: Keep up with daily routines as far as possible, or make new ones. Get up and go to bed at similar times every day; Keep up with personal hygiene; Eat healthy meals at regular times; Exercise regularly; Allocate time for working and time for resting; Make time for doing things you enjoy.  
 Minimize newsfeeds: Try to reduce how much you watch, read or listen to news that makes you feel anxious or distressed. Seek the latest information at specific times of the day, once or twice a day if needed. 
 Social contact is important: If your movements are restricted, keep in regular contact with people close to you by telephone and online channels. 
 Alcohol and drug use: Limit the amount of alcohol you drink or don’t drink alcohol at all. Don’t start drinking alcohol if you have not drunk alcohol before. Avoid using alcohol and drugs as a way of dealing with fear, anxiety, boredom and social isolation. There is no evidence of any protective effect of drinking alcohol for viral or other infections. In fact, the opposite is true as the harmful use of alcohol is associated with increased risk of infections and worse treatment outcomes. And be aware that alcohol and drug use may prevent you from taking sufficient precautions to protect yourself again infection, such as compliance with hand hygiene. 
 Screen time: Be aware of how much time you spend in front of a screen every day. Make sure that you take regular breaks from on-screen activities. 
 Video games: While video games can be a way to relax, it can be tempting to spend much more time on them than usual when at home for long periods. Be sure to keep the right balance with off-line activities in your daily routine. 
 Social media: Use your social media accounts to promote positive and hopeful stories. Correct misinformation wherever you see it. 
 Help others: If you are able to, offer support to people in your community who may need it, such as helping them with food shopping. 
 Support health workers: Take opportunities online or through your community to thank your country’s health-care workers and all those working to respond to COVID-19. 
 Don’t discriminate: Fear is a normal reaction in situations of uncertainty. But sometimes fear is expressed in ways which are hurtful to other people. Remember: Be kind. Don’t discriminate against people because of your fears of the spread of COVID-19; Don’t discriminate against people who you think may have coronavirus; Don’t discriminate against health workers. Health workers deserve our respect and gratitude; COVID-19 has affected people from many countries. Don’t attribute it to any specific group.  
 If you are a parent: In times of stress, it is common for children to seek more of your attention. What you can do: Maintain familiar routines as much as possible, or create new ones, especially if you must stay at home; Discuss the new coronavirus with your children in an honest way, using age-appropriate language; Support your children with at-home learning and make sure time is set aside for play; Help children find positive ways to express feelings such as fear and sadness. Sometimes engaging in a creative activity, such as playing or drawing, can help you with this process; Help children stay in contact with friends and family members through telephone and online channels; Make sure that your children have time away from screens every day and spend time doing off-line activities together. Do something creative: draw a picture, write a poem, build something. Bake a cake. Sing or dance, or play in your garden, if you have one; Try and ensure that your children do not spend significantly more time than usual on video games.  
 If you are an older adult: Keep in regular contact with loved ones, for example by telephone, e-mail, social media or video conference; Keep regular routines and schedules as much as possible for eating, sleeping, and activities you enjoy; Learn simple daily physical exercises to do at home when in quarantine so you can maintain mobility; Find out how to get practical help if needed, like calling a taxi, having food delivered or asking for medical care. Make sure you have a one-month supply or longer of your regular medicines. Ask family members, friends or neighbours for support, if needed.  
 If you have a mental health condition: If you are being treated for a mental health condition, make sure that you continue to take medication as prescribed, and that you have a way of re-stocking your medication. If you are see a mental health specialist, find out how to continue with that support during the outbreak 
 Keep in touch with people who care for you and know who you can contact for support if your mental health declines; If you are being treated for an alcohol or drug use disorder, be aware that the COVID-19 outbreak may lead to increased feelings of fear, anxiety and isolation that can increase the risk of relapse, substance use, disengagement from treatment or non-compliance with treatment regimens. Make sure that you continue to take medication as prescribed, particularly if you receive treatment with opioid medicines such as methadone or buprenorphine, and that you have a way of obtaining a regular supply of your medication. If you are receiving support through a psychologist or support group, find out how to continue that support during the outbreak; If you are being treated for gaming or gambling disorder, continue with your treatment if possible. Check with your therapist or health-care provider about the best way of continuing with therapy during confinement at home.",Mental Health,WHO
5,"Why should you quit smoking and how can you do it? Smokers have a higher risk of getting coronavirus because they are constantly putting their hands to their lips. And then, if they get coronavirus, they run a greater risk of getting a severe case because their lung function is impaired.Quit today to reduce these risks and start living a healthier life. Quick tips to curb your cravings: Delay: Delay as long as you can before giving in to your urge; Deep breathing: Take 10 deep breaths to relax yourself from within until the urge passes; Drink water: Drinking water is a healthy alternative to sticking a cigarette in your mouth; Do something else to distract yourself: Take a shower, read, go for a walk, listen to music! There are many resources within your own community. Find out if your healthcare providers, Quit line Counsellors,  mCessation programmes are available to support you in your journey to quit.",Quitting Smoking,WHO
6,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) advice for the public: Myth busters 
 Can people wear masks while exercising? 
 People should NOT wear masks when exercising as masks may reduce the ability to breathe comfortably. Sweat can make the mask become wet more quickly which makes it difficult to breathe and promotes the growth of microorganisms. The important preventive measure during exercise is to maintain physical distance of at least one meter from others. 
 Can shoes spread the COVID-19 virus? The likelihood of COVID-19 being spread on shoes and infecting individuals is very low. As a precautionary measure, particularly in homes where infants and small children crawl or play on floors, consider leaving your shoes at the entrance of your home. This will help prevent contact with dirt or any waste  that could be carried on the soles of shoes. 
 FACT:The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by a virus. NOT by bacteria. The virus that causes COVID-19 is in a family of viruses called Coronaviridae. Antibiotics do not work against viruses. Some people who become ill with COVID-19 can also develop a bacterial infection as a complication. In this case, antibiotics may be recommended by a health care provider. There is currently no licensed medication to cure COVID-19. If you have symptoms, call your health care provider or COVID-19 hotline for assistance. 
 The prolonged use of medical masks (also known as surgical masks are flat or pleated; they are affixed to the head with straps or have ear loops) when properly worn, DOES NOT cause CO2 intoxication nor oxygen deficiency The prolonged use of medical masks can be uncomfortable. However, it does not lead to CO2 intoxication nor oxygen deficiency. While wearing a medical mask, make sure it fits properly and that it is tight enough to allow you to breathe normally. Do not re-use a disposable mask and always change it as soon as it gets damp. 
 Most people who get COVID-19 recover from it Most people who get COVID-19 have mild or moderate symptoms and can recover thanks to supportive care. If you have a cough, fever and difficulty breathing seek medical care early - call your health facility by telephone first. If you have fever and live in an area with malaria or dengue seek medical care immediately. 
 Drinking alcohol does not protect you against COVID-19 and can be dangerous. The harmful use of alcohol increases your risk of health problems. 
 Thermal scanners CANNOT detect COVID-19: Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature). They cannot detect people who are infected with COVID-19. There are many causes of fever. Call your healthcare provider if you need assistance or seek immediate medical care if you have fever and live in an area with malaria or dengue. 
 There are currently no drugs licensed for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19: While several drug trials are ongoing, there is currently no proof that hydroxychloroquine or any other drug can cure or prevent COVID-19. The misuse of hydroxychloroquine can cause serious side effects and illness and even lead to death. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop and evaluate medicines to treat COVID-19. 
 Adding pepper to your soup or other meals DOES NOT prevent or cure COVID-19: Hot peppers in your food, though very tasty, cannot prevent or cure COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is to keep at least 1 metre away from others and to wash your hands frequently and thoroughly. It is also beneficial for your general health to maintain a balanced diet, stay well hydrated, exercise regularly and sleep well. 
 COVID-19 IS NOT transmitted through houseflies: To date, there is no evidence or information to suggest that the COVID-19 virus transmitted through houseflies. The virus that cause COVID-19 spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. You can also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth before washing your hands. To protect yourself, keep at least 1-metre distance from others and disinfect frequently-touched surfaces. Clean your hands thoroughly and often and avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose. 
 Spraying and introducing bleach or another disinfectant into your body WILL NOT protect you against COVID-19 and can be dangerous: Do not under any circumstance spray or introduce bleach or any other disinfectant into your body. These substances can be poisonous if ingested and cause irritation and damage to your skin and eyes. Bleach and disinfectant should be used carefully to disinfect surfaces only. Remember to keep chlorine (bleach) and other disinfectants out of reach of children. 
 Drinking methanol, ethanol or bleach DOES NOT prevent or cure COVID-19 and can be extremely dangerous: Methanol, ethanol, and bleach are poisons. Drinking them can lead to disability and death. Methanol, ethanol, and bleach are sometimes used in cleaning products to kill the virus on surfaces – however you should never drink them. They will not kill the virus in your body and they will harm your internal organs. To protect yourself against COVID-19, disinfect objects and surfaces, especially the ones you touch regularly. You can use diluted bleach or alcohol for that. Make sure you clean your hands frequently and thoroughly and avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose. 
 5G mobile networks DO NOT spread COVID-19: Viruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile networks. COVID-19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks. COVID-19 is spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then their eyes, mouth or nose. 
 Exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25C degrees DOES NOT prevent the coronavirus disease (COVID-19): You can catch COVID-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is. Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19. To protect yourself, make sure you clean your hands frequently and thoroughly and avoid touching your eyes, mouth, and nose. 
 You can recover from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Catching the new coronavirus DOES NOT mean you will have it for life: Most of the people who catch COVID-19 can recover and eliminate the virus from their bodies. If you catch the disease, make sure you treat your symptoms. If you have cough, fever, and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early – but call your health facility by telephone first. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. 
 Being able to hold your breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort DOES NOT mean you are free from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) or any other lung disease: The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are dry cough, tiredness and fever. Some people may develop more severe forms of the disease, such as pneumonia. The best way to confirm if you have  the virus producing COVID-19 disease is with a laboratory test.  You cannot confirm it with this breathing exercise, which can even be dangerous. 
  Drinking alcohol does not protect you against COVID-19 and can be dangerous: Frequent or excessive alcohol consumption can increase your risk of health problems. 
 COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates: The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by maintaining physical distance of at least 1 metre from others and frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose. 
 Cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the new coronavirus: There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the external temperature or weather. The most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water. 
 Taking a hot bath does not prevent the new coronavirus disease: Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your normal body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. Actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose. 
 The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites: To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing. 
 Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus: No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer. 
 Ultra-violet (UV) lamps should not be used to disinfect hands or other areas of your skin: UV radiation can cause skin irritation and damage your eyes. Cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing your hands with soap and water are the most effective ways to remove the virus. 
 Thermal scanners CANNOT detect COVID-19: Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature). They cannot detect people who are infected with COVID-19. There are many causes of fever. Call your healthcare provider if you need assistance or seek immediate medical care if you have fever and live in an area with malaria or dengue. 
 Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus? No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus. The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts. Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. 
 Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus? No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus. There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. 
 Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus? Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. 
 Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible? People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. 
 Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus? No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. 
 Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus? To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners.

7,"If you are self-isolating because of coronavirus, there are things you can do to reduce the chances of spreading any infection to the people you live with. 
 Try to stay away from people you live with: If you have symptoms, you should stay away from other people you live with as much as possible. If you can: stay on your own in one room as much as possible and keep the door closed; avoid using shared spaces (such as the kitchen) at the same time as other people – eat your meals in your room; use a separate bathroom - otherwise, use the bathroom after everyone else and clean it each time you use it, for example, by wiping the surfaces you've touched. 
 How to reduce the spread of infection in your home: wash your hands with soap and water often, for at least 20 seconds. use hand sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available; cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when you cough or sneeze; put used tissues in the bin immediately and wash your hands afterwards; clean objects and surfaces you touch often (such as door handles, kettles and phones) using your regular cleaning products; consider wearing a face covering when in shared spaces; keep windows open in the room you're staying in and shared spaces as much as possible. 
 do not share towels, including hand towels and tea towels. 
 If you live with someone at higher risk from coronavirus: It's especially important to try to avoid spreading the infection to anyone who's at higher risk from coronavirus (such as people who are 70 or over, pregnant or have a weakened immune system). If you live with someone at higher risk, try to arrange for them to stay with friends or family while you're self-isolating. If you have to stay at home together, try to keep 2 metres (3 steps) away from each other. If possible, try not to share a bed. 
 ",Avoiding Spread,NHS-UK
8,"Advice about staying at home (self-isolation) and treatment for you and anyone you live with: Self-isolation is when you stay at home because you have or might have coronavirus (COVID-19). This helps stop the virus spreading to other people. 
 Self-isolate if: you have any symptoms of coronavirus (a high temperature, a new, continuous cough or a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste); you're waiting for a coronavirus test result; you've tested positive for coronavirus – this means you have coronavirus; you live with someone who has symptoms, is waiting for a test result or has tested positive; someone in your support bubble has symptoms, is waiting for a test result or has tested positive. A support bubble is where people who live alone (or just with their children) meet people from 1 other household. 
 How to self-isolate: You must not leave your home if you're self-isolating: Do not go to work, school or public places – work from home if you can; do not go on public transport or use taxis; do not go out to get food and medicine – order it online or by phone, or ask someone to bring it to your home; do not have visitors in your home, including friends and family – except for people providing essential care; do not go out to exercise – exercise at home or in your garden, if you have one. 
 Get a test if you have symptoms: If you have symptoms, get a test to check if you have coronavirus as soon as possible. The test needs to be done in the first 5 days of having symptoms. 
 Tell people you've been in close contact with that you have symptoms: You may want to tell people you've been in close contact with in the past 48 hours that you might have coronavirus. What does close contact mean?  They do not need to self-isolate unless they're contacted by the NHS Test and Trace service. But they should take extra care to follow social distancing advice, including washing their hands often. If they get any coronavirus symptoms, they must self-isolate and get a coronavirus test as soon as possible. 
 How long to self-isolate: If you have symptoms of coronavirus, you'll usually need to self-isolate for at least 7 days. If you live with someone who has symptoms, you'll usually need to self-isolate for 14 days. If someone in your support bubble has symptoms, you'll usually need to self-isolate for 14 days. Get an isolation note for your employer if you're unable to work. If you need to self-isolate, you can get an isolation note to send to your employer as proof you need to be off work.  You do not need to get a note from a GP.",Isolation Guide,NHS-UK
9,"How to look after your health and wellbeing. Staying at home and reducing contact with other people can be difficult. There are things you can try to help you stay well: stay in touch with family and friends over the phone or on social media; spend time doing things you enjoy, such as reading, cooking, indoor hobbies, listening to the radio or watching TV; do light exercise at home; spend time with the windows open to let in fresh air; spend time in your garden or on your doorstep, if possible, but stay at least 2 metres (3 steps) away from other people; consider taking 10 micrograms of vitamin D each day if you’re indoors most of the day – this is to keep your bones and muscles healthy; For more advice about looking after your mental wellbeing while you're at home.

 If you have a high temperature, it can help to: get lots of rest; drink plenty of fluids (water is best) to avoid dehydration – drink enough so your pee is light yellow and clear; take paracetamol or ibuprofen if you feel uncomfortable; Is it safe to take ibuprofen if I have symptoms of coronavirus? 
 Treating a cough: If you have a cough, it's best to avoid lying on your back. Lie on your side or sit upright instead. To help ease a cough, try having a teaspoon of honey. But do not give honey to babies under 12 months. If this does not help, you could contact a pharmacist for advice about cough treatments. Do not go to a pharmacy in person. If you or someone you live with has coronavirus symptoms, you must all stay at home. Try calling or contacting the pharmacy online instead. 
 Things to try if you're feeling breathless: If you're feeling breathless, it can help to keep your room cool. Try turning the heating down or opening a window. Do not use a fan as it may spread the virus. You could also try: breathing slowly in through your nose and out through your mouth, with your lips together like you're gently blowing out a candle; sitting upright in a chair; relaxing your shoulders, so you're not hunched; leaning forward slightly – support yourself by putting your hands on your knees or on something stable like a chair; Try not to panic if you're feeling breathless. This can make it worse.",Treatment,NHS-UK
11,"Taking care of your mind as well as your body is really important if you need to stay at home or you are shielding because of coronavirus (COVID-19). You may feel bored, frustrated or lonely. You may also be low, worried or anxious, or concerned about your finances, your health or those close to you. 
 It's important to remember that it's OK to feel this way and that everyone reacts differently. Remember, for most of us, these feelings will pass. Staying at home may be difficult, but you're helping to protect yourself and others by doing it. The tips and advice here are things you can do now to help you keep on top of your mental wellbeing and cope with how you may feel if you're staying at home. Make sure you get further support if you feel you need it. 
 Find out about your employment and benefits rights: You may be worried about work and money while you have to stay home – these issues can have a big effect on your mental health. If you have not already, you might want to talk with your employer. Find out about government support for businesses and self-employed people and understand your sick pay and benefits rights. Knowing the details about what the coronavirus outbreak means for you (England and Wales only) can reduce worry and help you feel more in control.  
 Plan practical things: If you're unable to get to the shops, work out how you can get any household supplies you need. You could try asking neighbours or family friends, or find a delivery service. Continue accessing treatment and support for any existing physical or mental health problems where possible. Let services know you are staying at home, and discuss how to continue receiving support. If you need regular medicine, you might be able to order repeat prescriptions by phone, or online via a website or app. Contact your GP and ask if they offer this. You can also ask your pharmacy about getting your medicine delivered, or ask someone else to collect it for you. If you support or care for others, either in your home or by visiting them regularly, think about who can help out while you are staying at home. Let your local authority (England, Scotland and Wales only) know if you provide care or support someone you do not live with. Carers UK has further advice on creating a contingency plan. 
 Stay connected with others: Maintaining healthy relationships with people you trust is important for your mental wellbeing. Think about how you can stay in touch with friends and family if you or they need to stay at home – by phone, messaging, video calls or social media – whether it's people you usually saw often, or reconnecting with old friends.  
 Talk about your worries: It's normal to feel a bit worried, scared or helpless about the current situation. Remember: it is OK to share your concerns with others you trust – and doing so may help them too. If you cannot speak to someone you know or if doing so has not helped, there are plenty of helplines you can try instead.  
 Look after your body: Our physical health has a big impact on how we feel. At times like these, it can be easy to fall into unhealthy patterns of behaviour that end up making you feel worse. Try to eat healthy, well-balanced meals, drink enough water and exercise regularly. Avoid smoking or drugs, and try not to drink too much alcohol. Going for a walk, run or bike ride is a great way to lift your mood and clear your head – just make you stay at least 2 metres apart from others. Or you could try one of our easy 10-minute home workouts.  
 Stay on top of difficult feelings: Concern about the coronavirus outbreak is perfectly normal. However, some people may experience intense anxiety that can affect their day-to-day life. Try to focus on the things you can control, such as how you act, who you speak to and where you get information from. It's fine to acknowledge that some things are outside of your control, but if constant thoughts about the situation are making you feel anxious or overwhelmed, try some ideas to help manage your anxiety.  
 Do not stay glued to the news: Try to limit the time you spend watching, reading or listening to coverage of the outbreak, including on social media, and think about turning off breaking-news alerts on your phone. You could set yourself a specific time to read updates or limit yourself to checking a couple of times a day. Use trustworthy sources – such as GOV.UK or the NHS website – and fact-check information from the news, social media or other people.  
 Carry on doing things you enjoy: If we are feeling worried, anxious, lonely or low, we may stop doing things we usually enjoy. Make an effort to focus on your favourite hobby if it is something you can still do at home. If not, picking something new to learn at home might help. There are lots of free tutorials and courses online, and people are coming up with inventive ways to do things, like hosting online pub quizzes and music concerts.Take time to relax: This can help with difficult emotions and worries, and improve our wellbeing. Relaxation techniques can also help deal with feelings of anxiety.  
 Think about your new daily routine: Life is changing for a while and it's likely your normal routine has been disrupted. Think about how you can adapt and create positive new routines and set yourself goals. You might find it helpful to write a plan for your day or your week. If you're working from home, try to get up and get ready in the same way as normal, keep to the same hours you would normally work and stick to the same sleeping schedule. You could set a new time for a daily home workout, and pick a regular time to clean, read, watch a TV programme or film, or cook.  
 Look after your sleep: Good-quality sleep makes a big difference to how we feel, so it's important to get enough. Try to maintain your regular sleeping pattern and stick to good sleep practices.  
 Keep your mind active: Read, write, play games, do crosswords, complete sudoku puzzles, finish jigsaws, or try drawing and painting. Whatever it is, find something that works for you.",Mental Health,NHS-UK
